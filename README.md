## Configuration

Before using the bot, you need to set up your configuration file. This file contains your API keys and other settings.

1. Open the `config.json` file in the project directory.
2. Fill in your API keys for the exchanges you want to trade on.
3. Set your trading parameters, such as trading pairs and strategy options.

}
```

## Strategies

The bot supports various trading strategies. You can either use the built-in strategies or create your own. Here are a few popular strategies:

### Moving Average Crossover

This strategy uses two moving averages (a short-term and a long-term) to determine buy and sell signals. When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, it signals a buy. Conversely, when it crosses below, it signals a sell.

### RSI Strategy

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. A common strategy is to buy when the RSI is below 30 and sell when it is above 70.

### Bollinger Bands

This strategy uses Bollinger Bands to identify overbought or oversold conditions. Traders buy when the price touches the lower band and sell when it touches the upper band.

You can find more detailed information about each strategy in the `strategies` folder within the repository.
